5. Settings > Connected Accounts
	Create & fill out as many social media accounts as you can. This is great "low-hanging fruit," i.e. small things you can do to get a quick boost in your rankings. Social media sites typically rank well on search engines because they're highly trusted and active websites. 
	Note: put the URL of your website in your social media accounts' profile. These are called backlinks and act as "votes of confidence" for your site, which will help rankings. 
6. Settings > Blogging
	Change the default blog permalinks to just contain “TITLE”
	Remove all of the superfluous date info (day/month/year) from this field, Google doesn’t like it.
