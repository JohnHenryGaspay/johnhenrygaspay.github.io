In order to understand how different traffic segments convert in Google Analytics, you need to segment the funnels.
Follow the steps below:
Step-1: Create filtered views (profiles) for each of the following traffic sources:
Organic Search Traffic
Paid Search Traffic
Referral Traffic
Direct Traffic
Social Media
Mobile traffic
Tablet Traffic
Desktop Traffic

Step-2: Set up goals and funnel pages for each filtered view.
Step-3: Wait for at least a month, so that enough traffic data populates, into the funnel visualization report of each filtered view.
Once the 30 days of data has populated into the funnel visualization reports, you are ready to interpret goals/sales funnel for each traffic source.
